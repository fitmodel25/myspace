h1. MySpace Parser

This library is a really simple parser built using the excellent Hpricot library for Ruby.

I'm publishing it because people have asked me for it. Here. Have it. It's free software![1]

h2. How you can help

* Extend it to support more of MySpace's terrible markup abominations
* Write test cases[2] so we can make this thing not fail.

fn1. It's licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" rev="vote-for">GNU Public License</a>. You are free, but not free to make others unfree.[3]

fn2. Yes, I know it's not really a unit test since it's having to poll the network. And, no, I don't really care.

fn3. Yes, I use a Mac. I know that makes me a hypocrite on subjects related to free software.
